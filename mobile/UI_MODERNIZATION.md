# NotesGPT UI Modernization

## Project Overview
The objective of this project was to modernize the UI of the NotesGPT mobile app while maintaining all existing functionality. NotesGPT allows users to record voice notes, process them with AI, and organize them in folders.

## Completed Tasks

### Foundation
- Added essential UI packages:

  - React Native Vector Icons (for Ionicons)

### Theme System
- Created a comprehensive theme system in `theme.js`:
  - Cohesive color palette with primary (purple) and accent (pink) colors
  - Consistent spacing and typography scales
  - Custom elevation/shadow styles for consistent depth
